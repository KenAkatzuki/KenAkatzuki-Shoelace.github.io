# Welcome to Port Nave

Welcome to **Port Nave**, where things are a bit oddly structured.  
Website hosted by GitHub. Above, there is a badge named **My Room** where the website lies. So, if you want to sail there, you can just click the badge and you’ll be there.  
But beware—there are many catches before you set sail. Know your place, as there's an **Unknown Being'S Crawling** there, watching for your life (data).

## Testing Games In Linux

**Testme117** is my YouTube channel where I test games via **Wine** and **Proton**.  
Sometimes, I also make gameplay videos.  
I notify changes in tools and ProtonDB, the respected games forum, when possible.  
I check in on the community to see where Linux is going in gaming or software (and leave some messages there).

You can find my YouTube channel via the **Yellow Badge** above, or just go through my profile.

Enjoy the ride, and remember: the journey is just as important as the destination.
